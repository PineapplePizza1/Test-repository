Tips on Merge,
SO essentially, check out a branch, means to take it and start working on one of those branch nodes
commit local changes to the local branch.
then, once you're done, merge it to the develop or main, in order to get a version that is full of all the other stuff
then push to the stable main later.

that connects the branch, and allows you to push changes to the remote main.
